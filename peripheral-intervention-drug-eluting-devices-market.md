<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drug-Eluting Balloons</li><li>Drug-Eluting Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices market comprises two primary types: Drug-Eluting Balloons and Drug-Eluting Stents. Drug-Eluting Balloons are coated with therapeutic agents that reduce restenosis and are inflated in the narrowed artery to deliver medication. Drug-Eluting Stents, on the other hand, are scaffold-like devices that maintain artery patency while releasing drugs over time to prevent blockage. Both devices aim to enhance treatment outcomes for patients with peripheral arterial disease by minimizing the risk of re-narrowing and improving blood flow.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plain Old Balloon Angioplasty (POBA)</li><li>Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Peripheral Intervention Drug-Eluting Devices Market encompasses applications such as Plain Old Balloon Angioplasty (POBA) and Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA). POBA is a traditional method where a balloon catheter is inflated to open narrowed arteries, while PTA involves a similar process but often incorporates stenting for enhanced results. Both approaches aim to restore blood flow in peripheral arteries, treating conditions like atherosclerosis. Drug-eluting devices enhance these procedures by releasing medication to prevent restenosis, improving long-term outcomes.</p></p>
