<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Pacing Therapy System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Diaphragm Pacemaker</li><li>Diaphragm Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Diaphragm Pacing Therapy System market primarily consists of two types: External Diaphragm Pacemakers and implanted Diaphragm Pacemakers. External Diaphragm Pacemakers are non-invasive devices worn outside the body, stimulating diaphragm movement through surface electrodes. In contrast, implanted Diaphragm Pacemakers involve surgical placement of electrodes directly on the diaphragm, offering more permanent and potentially effective respiratory support for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction. Both options aim to enhance breathing control and improve quality of life for individuals with specific medical conditions.</p></p>
