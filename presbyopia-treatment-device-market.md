<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Presbyopia Treatment Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corneal Inlays</li><li>Scleral Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The presbyopia treatment device market features two primary types: corneal inlays and scleral implants. Corneal inlays are small implants placed in the cornea to improve near vision by altering the eye's focus, offering a minimally invasive solution. Scleral implants, on the other hand, are placed on the surface of the sclera, the white part of the eye, to enhance visual acuity by providing additional support and stability. Both methods aim to restore clear vision for individuals experiencing age-related sight changes.</p></p>
